# Mushroom-Classification
Mushrooms being the most sustainably produced foods, not only have good taste but also hold a great 
nutritional value. They contain proteins, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These can have various 
health benefits. Mushrooms aid in strengthening our immune system and help us to lose weight. They 
are a beguiling mixture of lucrative as well as speculative features.
But aside from the healthy mushrooms, there also exists poisonous and wild mushrooms whose 
consumption may result in severe illnesses in humans and can even cause death. It is not easy for a 
layman to differentiate wild mushrooms from healthy mushrooms.
In this project, we have used dataset which simulates various characteristics of mushroomsâ€™ physical 
appearances such as cap shapes, cap colours, cap surfaces, odor, gills spacing, gills attachment, gill 
colour and stalk shape are among many other features.
